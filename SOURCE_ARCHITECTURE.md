## 1. The Big Picture

In 2013, Ubisoft released ***Prince of Persia: The Shadow and the Flame*** for Android and iOS smartphones. It was built using a 3D game engine called **ShiVa3D**. The game never received an official PC release.

Normally, when a game company ports a game from phone to PC, they open up the original human-readable source code (millions of lines of C++ text files), reconfigure the project in Visual Studio on Windows, click "Compile", and fix any bugs.

**We do not have Ubisoft's original source code.**
All we have is the published Android game file: a file called `libS3DClient.so` extracted from an Android phone.

This project is a **native dynamic binary translation port**. Rather than running a heavyweight Android emulator (which boots an entire Android operating system inside a virtual machine and runs sluggishly), our project loads the game's compiled mobile code **directly into Windows memory**, translates its phone instructions to PC instructions at blinding speed, and fools the game into believing it is running on a high-end Android phone while sending all graphics, sound, and controls directly to Windows, DirectX/OpenGL, and your graphics card.

---

## 2. The Core Dilemma: Aliens and Translators

To understand why this codebase exists, imagine two people:
1. **The Game (`libS3DClient.so`)**: A French chef who only knows how to speak French, only knows how to cook in a French mobile kitchen, and expects French suppliers.
2. **Your Computer (Windows x64 PC)**: An English landlord who only understands English instructions, has an American electric kitchen, and uses English plumbing.

If you throw the French chef into the English house with no preparation:
- The chef speaks ARM machine code. Your CPU only understands x86_64 machine code. **Total incomprehension (Crash #1).**
- The chef shouts: *"Where is the Android Java Virtual Machine?"* Windows says: *"I have no idea what that is."* **Crash #2.**
- The chef asks for Android Linux memory allocation (`/dev/ashmem` or Bionic libc). Windows has Windows Heap (`VirtualAlloc`). **Crash #3.**
- The chef draws using OpenGL ES 2.0 with mobile compressed textures (ETC1). Your desktop graphics card uses Desktop OpenGL with desktop textures (DXT/BC). **Black screen (Crash #4).**
- The chef makes sound using OpenSL ES or Android AudioTrack. Windows uses WASAPI or DirectSound. **Silence (Crash #5).**

### Our Solution: The Spy and Bridge Network
Our C/C++ program acts as a **complete undercover bridge network**:
- Whenever the game tries to run ARM code, our JIT compiler (`Dynarmic`) instantly translates it into PC machine code.
- Whenever the game asks for an Android service, our code steps in, impersonates Android, gives the exact expected answer, and translates the request into a native Windows command.

The game thinks it is running on the fastest Android phone on Earth!

## 4. The 7 Pillars of the Engine

### Pillar 1: Dynamic Binary Translation (Dynarmic JIT)
Smartphones use **ARM CPUs** (RISC architecture: 32-bit registers, simple instructions).
PCs use **x86_64 CPUs** (CISC architecture: 64-bit complex instructions).
Instead of interpreting ARM instructions one by one, we use **Dynarmic**, a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler. Dynarmic translates blocks of ARM code directly into equivalent x86_64 machine code at native execution speed. Dynarmic is linked as a precompiled static fat library (`libdynarmic.a`) that encapsulates the ARM32 translation core and internal dependencies without needing Boost sources in the tree.

### Pillar 2: The Binary Loader (ELF32)
Mobile game libraries are packaged as `.so` files (Shared Objects in Linux ELF format). Windows only knows how to load `.dll` files (PE format). Our custom **ELF loader** (`src/elf32/`) parses the sections of `libS3DClient.so`, copies them to memory address `0x01000000`, performs ARM dynamic relocations, and binds external symbol imports to our C bridge functions.

### Pillar 3: The C Standard Library Bridge (`bridge_libc`)
Every C program relies on basic helper functions (`malloc`, `free`, `fopen`, `printf`). On Android, these belong to Google's Bionic C library:
- **Segregated Heap Allocator**: 2-gigabyte heap with 28 separate size bins ensuring the game never fragments or runs out of RAM.
- **POSIX Directory Traversal (`scandir` & `alphasort`)**: Implements Bionic directory scanning (`/system/fonts`, `./Cache`), allocating guest 280-byte `dirent` structs, sorting filenames via `alphasort` (`strcoll`), and delivering guest pointer arrays.
- **Render Queue `qsort` Comparators**: Intercepts guest comparison function pointers (`render_cmp_5e8a1c` for player render priority, `render_cmp_797d38` for distance-sorted mesh subsets) so sorting executes safely in host C.

### Pillar 4: The Graphics Bridge (`bridge_gles`)
Smartphones use **OpenGL ES 2.0**. PCs use **Desktop OpenGL or DirectX**:
- Phones use **ETC1 compressed textures** to save memory. Our bridge includes a software decompression algorithm converting ETC1 blocks into 32-bit RGBA pixels in memory on the fly.
- Mobile shaders use GLSL ES 1.00 (`precision mediump float;`). Our bridge automatically translates shaders to Desktop GLSL 1.20 during compilation.

### Pillar 5: The Audio Bridge (`bridge_openal`)
Phones send sound through Android audio streams. We redirect sound buffer uploads and 3D positioning calls to **OpenAL Soft**, providing 3D spatial surround sound and pitch-perfect music playback.

### Pillar 6: The Virtual STK File System
When ShiVa3D loads models and textures, it opens `S3DMain.stk` thousands of times without closing them. Opening 2,048 files exhausts the Windows file limit and crashes the game. Our **Virtual STK File System** opens the physical archive file once and assigns virtual file descriptors, tracking offsets internally to prevent leaked Windows handles. Furthermore, our VFS allows the entire game to run **100% STK-only**, eliminating the need for thousands of loose files on disk.

### Pillar 7: The Unified Configuration & Launcher Ecosystem
A native PC port needs modern graphics controls and flexible key rebinding without requiring players to edit raw text files. The standalone **PoPSnF_Launcher** provides:
- **Instant Asset Provisioning**: Extracts `libS3DClient.so`, `S3DMain.stk`, and the Android activity's `app_splash.png` directly from any standard Android `.apk` file using `miniz` in under a second. The splash is a host-side startup resource, not an STK asset.
- **Display & Quality Configuration**: Grants full control over widescreen resolutions (up to 4K UHD), borderless fullscreen, 60 FPS VSync, MSAA antialiasing (up to 8x), and anisotropic filtering (up to 16x).
- **Intelligent Input Remapping**:
  - **Conflict Swapping**: Automatically swaps keys when rebinding conflicting actions.
  - **Scroll Wheel Input**: Binds mouse scroll wheel ticks (`Wheel Up`, `Wheel Down`, etc.) with game-side 3-frame pulse generation.
  - **Dolphin-Style Escape Key Binding**: Supports binding the `Escape` key itself via hold-to-bind ($\ge 750\text{ ms}$) or double-tap, while a quick tap cancels.
  - **Undo / Redo History**: Reverts or reapplies changes with `Ctrl+Z`, `Ctrl+Y`, and on-screen controls.

### `src/main.cpp` - The Conductor
1. Loads user display and control configurations from `game/config.ini`.
2. Configures the asynchronous Windows anonymous pipe tee logger (`setup_dual_logging`, `log_tee_thread`), piping console output to `game/pop_pc.log` and `game/logs/`.
3. Creates the borderless fullscreen or windowed screen using SDL2 with requested MSAA and VSync attributes.
4. Resolves the game directory path to `game/` and sets working directory isolation.
